### Ultra fast install of doom of the apocalypse
Just need to put that URL into your browser [`jaloader://install/Jalopy-Mods/Malmo-Engine`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (Need [Jaloader installed](https://github.com/theLeaxx/JaLoader) first)

### I don't trust you
Then, you just need to install the latest release (on the right of your screen), then download the ZIP file, and extract everything in your Mods location, prob in `Documents\Jalopy\Mods`.

The whole thing is open-source. You can just get the entire solution in your favorite C# IDE, and build.
